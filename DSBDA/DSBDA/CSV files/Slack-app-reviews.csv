I wish I could put the channels in the order we use them the most, instead of the app just putting them where it wants. 
I had an issue with posting pics and tech help was friendly and got back with me quickly. The problem was resolved in a week or so. 
My biggest complaint is the app is bad about not giving notifications when it should. This is a real problem as many employees will not check the app unless it notifies them something has been posted. Every time there is an update, the notifications seem to work well for a few days… then they stop working again.

1,2022-04-14 14:50:10,,"The recent iPad App update misses the mark quite considerably. In some ways, it is almost as if Slack doesn’t understand its users. No longer easy to see all unread messages in one place - which was a feature I regularly requested for the desktop app. Now, the iPad app has been turned to be quite bland. Seems like the “Dark Mode” folks won the design argument; as the new app no longer supports the desktop or web app color themes; which now makes the iPad app incredibly difficult to know at a glance which team you’re viewing. Also frustrating are the 3 or so “Unread Direct Messages” you can see, when you tap “Show All” it takes you to the “Direct Messages” sidebar that sorts in its own way, with unreads strewn about. Also, Direct message addresses are much harder to read; too much text all clumped together. Unfortunate for the iPad app, Slack has taken a once very useful version (preferred as a second screen in some cases over the desktop app) and made it into a giant iPhone app. The iPhone app now also suffers from this Direct Message unread messages “Show All” problem. The only way to return some of the missing sort and see all DMs on the iPad app is to select the sort option of “by recent” but it does not group unreads. 7 years using Slack, and this is by far the most disappointing iPad app “upgrade.” Repackage the desktop app for the iPad and call it “Slack Pro” for iPad Pro users who use their iPad in place of a laptop.",2,False,"One Step Forward, Two Steps Back for iPad",RufHaus71

When pressing ENTER on the iPad keyboard, the message is not sent; you have to press a button. But this button is hidden behind a tiny floating language selection & dictation bar. I had to move it out of the way, and quickly hit ‘submit’ before the bar jumped back, a matter of milliseconds. I know Slack used to be a game company, but this is not the type of game I’m interested in playing :) 
I also find the app to respond slow on iPadOS, as if it’s not native but some kind of ‘HTML shell’ that doesn’t really bring the best of the native CPU/GPU capabilities. 
Lastly, I think they need to rework ‘search’. I would like to see a more clear distinction between ‘search everywhere’ and ‘search within the current channel or private conversation’. It takes ages to find something now. I also would like to see a more user friendly search query system (AND/OR) where I can add criteria. Right now it doesn’t ‘feel’ right - I know that doesn’t really help but perhaps they’d benefit from a larger user-acceptance phase for UX.

The ability to control editing window behavior is gone. Hardware keyboard integration is worse, with shortcut keys being removed. It's become riddled with bugs. Just scrolling the chat will randomly throw one of your messages into edit mode if you touch it wrong. Every couple of versions it stops accepting Return to send when using a hardware keyboard.

7,2020-12-03 15:39:54,,"Look, I love/d Slack. I’ve been using it as my internal business communication tool for the past five years. I’ve also noticed in those past five years, Slack has barely innovated and as of recently, especially during 2020 when most applications like zoom, Google meet, and Microsoft teams have been booming with innovation in new ways of interacting in this new work from home work life. Now with the acquisition from salesforce, I truly feel like Slack is going to go down the drain and what was once the industry leader in communication has sat back on the couch, slacking, watching everybody else move forward. As of today, we are looking into other platforms outside of Slack due to the lack of innovation and buy out from sales force. An example of what I think is easy innovative feedback, we’ve been asking for voice clips to send both privately and in channels up to 2 to 5 minutes long so managers can leave a status update or important message or daily briefing first thing in the morning without having to type it all out and can do it on the go; nothing.

8,2020-06-07 16:17:55,,"Overall the app works quite well. Some things are big misses for me though, especially notifications. Putting a lot of detail in hopes it is read by developers as I do want to love the app.

Searching for users when trying to start a DM doesn’t prioritize users you’ve talked to before. I work at a company with thousands of employees, so if I search for someone with a common first name and I don’t know their last name, I have to go through a list of 30 people when I’ve talked to them before and I’d expect them to just come up first.

Messages you read on web or on the app don’t dismiss notifications. I have to go dismiss them all one at a time even though the app should know I’ve read them. Big failing for me compared to something like FB messenger which will know to clear them.

There are no different snooze settings for different days of the week. I don’t work 7 days a week. Why would I want the same snooze settings?

There is no granularity on getting alerts for channels besides give me everything all the time, and give me nothing. If a conversation is happening I want to know about it, but I also don’t want my phone to completely blow up with 50 notifications beeping at me in 10 minutes. It would be much less distracting / annoying to group the messages and notify on configurable intervals

Lastly, if I get a message while snoozed I am not told about it once the snooze ends. This can lead to me not noticing a message for days",3,False,Good except for notifications,Ayrton117

Unfortunately, when you tap the link to “show all x” it takes you to the DMs screen where messages are in chronological order. This means my unread messages are scattered all over the place, and as a result I no longer have a way to just see all my unread messages grouped together.

That's not the case with a Mac app.

The result is that there's A TON of scrolling back and forth, trying to find the channel I'm looking for, since it can be in two places: with new messages and without new messages.

Then, there's ""starred"" channels, which have the same problem.

The UI is a nightmare. I spend more time scrolling through twice as many items on my list of channels than I do on my Macbook! And there's no option in settings to disable this.

- the screen recorder
- huddle
- the “set a reminder” tool
- the ease of giving feedback, the quick response to feedback, and the willingness to listen to users’ feedback
